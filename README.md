  # 🏡 Mexico House Price Analysis & Prediction using Machine Learning and showing an interactive dashboard using Power BI

📌 **Project Type**: Exploratory Data Analysis + Predictive Modeling + Dashboard  
📊 **Tools Used**: Python · Scikit-learn · Power BI · Pandas · Matplotlib · Ridge Regression · Linear Regression  
📁 **Dataset**: 21,000+ property listings in Mexico

---

## 🔍 Overview

In this project, I analyze over **21,000 real estate listings** across Mexico to answer a central question:

> **Are apartment prices in Mexico influenced more by property size or by location?**

To explore this, I use:
- 📍 **Geospatial visualizations** in **Power BI**
- 📈 **Correlation analysis**
- 🤖 **Machine learning models** (Linear and Ridge Regression)

---

## 💡 Objectives

- Understand the relationship between **price**, **location**, and **surface area**
- Build a **data pipeline** for preprocessing:
  - Imputing missing values
  - Encoding categorical variables
- Train **regression models** to predict apartment prices
- Use **Power BI** to visualize trends across boroughs and map prices geographically

---

## 🧠 Key Features

### 📊 Power BI Dashboard
- Interactive maps showing price by location
- Borough-wise average prices
- Surface area vs. price scatter plots


### 🤖 Machine Learning Pipeline
- Linear Regression & Ridge Regression
- Handling multicollinearity and overfitting
- Mean Absolute Squared Error 
- Pipeline for imputation and encoding

## 📝 Report

|   Model	          |  Baseline MAE   |	Val MAE      |
| Linear Regression |	17189.62        | 15200.969    |
|   Ridge	          |     17189.62  	|   15200.246  |


## 🧪 Sample Insights

- 📌 **Location** & **Surface area** plays a stronger role in price variation than property size
- 📈 Ridge Regression slightly outperforms Linear Regression by reducing overfitting
